Have you ever dreamed of displaying 3,000 colours on screen at once on your Atari STE? Well, a mere 37 years after the STE was released, here's a scanline-blasting plasma demo that will bring your dream to life. Enjoy.

Animation coming... soon? Maybe.

## Controls

### PLASMA1.TOS

- 1-4: Select visualisation
- Space: Next visualisation
- Esc: Quit

### PLASMA2.TOS

## Build

The quickest way to build this for yourself is to install [atarist-toolkit-docker](https://github.com/sidecartridge/atarist-toolkit-docker) and run:

```sh
stcmd make
```

Outputs `PLASMA1.TOS` and `PLASMA2.TOS` in the `build` folder.
